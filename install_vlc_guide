add "export
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig"
to .bash_profile

install automake autoconf libtool

tar -zxvf  vlc-2.0.8a.tar.xz
cd vlc-2.0.8a
run ./configure then it will complain that some package is
required;find these package in
10.239.116.175:/Public/CentOS/vlc/

note:while configure ffmpeg you need to run configure with
--enable-gpl --enable-pic

in the last there will be only one dependency unresolved --
openGL,still unresolved but it doesn't matter;you just run
with --disable-glx to avoid this configure error.then rum
make,sudo make install .as far,it's done without skins.
