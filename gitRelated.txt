git clone: fatal: Unable to find remote helper for 'https'
It looks like not having (lib)curl-devel installed when you install git can cause this.

If you install (lib)curl-devel, and then rebuild/install git, this should solve the problem:


svn-git
sudo apt-get install git-svn

git svn clone svnAddr


apply an existing commit to an exsisting branch

git checkout branch
git cherry-pick commitid
git remote -v to get remote url
